They woke me up while I was sleeping in the travel trailer in the driveway at about 8:30 AM, I got dressed and managed to yell out at one and asked him if they were inmates before he was able to walk across the railroad tracks, he yelled back \"yes\". I had to yell at him 2-3 times to get a response, he was about 100 yards away, I don't recall using the \"nicest\" language or tone of voice.\n\nThat upset the cop on the street, he walked to the front of my mother's driveway and acted upset.\n\nI asked the cop if they had a permit to walk across the railroad tracks, he said they did have a permit to walk across the railroad tracks. I asked him for contact information for the main person in charge of the inmate work crew (not them someone above them), he told me to call 911, I said it wasn't an emergency, he said \"Exactly!\".\n\nHe led me to believe that he was with the Stillaguamish Tribe, he didn't tell me he was a Snohomish County Sheriff deputy, I couldn't read his uniform at that time.\n\nHe was parked in the middle of the lane, he drove up and didn't park on the side of the road, he simply stopped and put the van in park forcing all cars to drive around it.",
